                <h2>About Dregg</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Dregg Raul C. Cabansay</strong>, a first-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student and one of the creators of this website. I’m just a simple guy with a passion for exploring the digital world and diving into various hobbies that fuel my creativity.</p>
                
                <p>I believe in the power of learning and growing in a constantly evolving field. As a tech enthusiast, I spend my time developing new skills, experimenting with code, and enjoying the endless possibilities of the digital realm. It's all about combining creativity with technical knowledge to build innovative projects that matter.</p>
                
                <h3>My Hobbies:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Playing Online Games:</strong> Engaging in competitive and casual gaming, where I can unwind and connect with friends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listening to Music:</strong> Music is an essential part of my life. I love a variety of genres like <em>hip-hop</em>, <em>country</em>, and <em>rap</em>, each giving me a unique vibe and energy depending on the mood.</li>
