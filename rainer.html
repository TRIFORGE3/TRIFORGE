                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Rainier P. Schwartz, a freshman/first-year student under the course Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). Im an aspiring programmer hoping to earn money in order to help my family. I also like computers, gadgets and everything technology-related. For my hobbies, I'm an avid gamer especially in the FPS (First-Person Shooter) category,  mainly Valorant, CSGO, etc. I also like to watch anime or series like true crime documentaries.

                    My passion for IT encourages me to help others and myself and contribute to projects like this to start. I believe that helping others can also improve me, not just as a programmer, but also grow into a person who is always there for others in need. To end this part of my introduction, I just want to leave you with my motto in life. "Go with the flow."

                    I hope you learned some things about me not just as a future programmer, but also a person. Thank you very much!
                </p>
